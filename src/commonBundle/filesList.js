    Hey, who recognizes this image?
    Recently I’ve watched the cartoon "Over The Garden Wall" and it impressed me pleasantly. It’s so kind, funny and light, yet very interesting! I like that it has short episodes too
    And you fall in love with the characters from the first episode😁
    And what are your impressions? I would like to watch more cartoons like this; maybe one of you has any suggestions? Please let me know!`,

    desc: `Today I will tell you a story about this graceful lady.
    As many of you know there are many fantastic things in our world, and this girl might be one of the strangest you will witness. Some say she is the personification of a gull, born from an egg with characteristics of both human and bird. It should not come as a surprise that she can talk to birds and soar through the skies just like a gull can.
    What surprises most, she says, she has an incredible obsession with peas. Everywhere she goes, she plants peas! And not just on our planet, no, she travels to different planets as well just to plant peas. She cherishes them just like a mother cherishes her children. Once they are fully grown, which can take up to a thousand years, a new star will be born.
    A beautiful sight to behold🌅✨`,

    Every Sunday we’d hang out in the secret treehouse we made in the garden of our grandparents, and while I was reading books she just kept on eating sweet stuff!📖👀
    It always looked really tempting, so every now then I joined her and ate more than I could handle.
    When I got older, it became easier for me to say no to these unhealthy things :)
    Sometimes I became a bit jealous because whatever my little sis ate, her teeth remained perfect and she didn’t gain any weight at all!`,

    desc: `The magical sisters Anna and Ley have always been rivals; quarreling, arguing and challenging each other every day. Because these fightsmore often than not got way out of control, their parents decided to separate them.
    While Anna got sent to the Land of the Fiery Seas, Ley departed to the mountains of Boreas. For many years they lived a lonely life and often got crazy. In these remote places they had no other choice than to be patient and behave.
    As years passed they gathered a lot of knowledge and slowly improved their magic abilities. Although they do not look old, they have been on this planet for centuries. Rumors say that they lived isolated for more than 200 years.
    Luckily for us, they are now well behaving siblings and use their magical powers for the wellbeing of humans, animals and nature🌿
    Though… sometimes they still like to play pranks with each other.. :>`,
