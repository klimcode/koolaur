    Today is a special day, because one of his animal friends will start a new job. So he swung them all in the air and gave them some new clothes! Can you spot the friend who will start today? ;)

    As many of you know there are many fantastic things in our world, and this girl might be one of the strangest you will witness. Some say she is the personification of a gull, born from an egg with characteristics of both human and bird. It should not come as a surprise that she can talk to birds and soar through the skies just like a gull can.
    What surprises most, she says, she has an incredible obsession with peas. Everywhere she goes, she plants peas! And not just on our planet, no, she travels to different planets as well just to plant peas. She cherishes them just like a mother cherishes her children. Once they are fully grown, which can take up to a thousand years, a new star will be born.
    A beautiful sight to behold üåÖ‚ú®`,

    As years passed they gathered a lot of knowledge and slowly improved their magic abilities. Although they do not look old, they have been on this planet for centuries. Rumors say that they lived isolated for more than 200 years.
